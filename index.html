            <p><b>What do I write?</b></p>
            <p>I can’t keep my hands off a good story. If your passion for a new idea is percolating anywhere near me—I want in. </p>
            I creatively approach not only what to say but also how to say it without sacrificing the bottom line. As a technologically adept self-starter who has worked in the private and public sectors, there is no industry I cannot write my way into.</p>
            I’m looking for the next big story to tell. What’s yours? </p>
            <p><b>What can you read?</b></p>
            <p>Below, you will find summaries of copy that I produced for various organizations and some of my favorite research projects. Many of these samples are not shared in their entirety due to fair use restrictions, but most full manuscripts are available upon request.  </p>
            <p><b>What is Rhetoric and Composition?</b></p>
            <p>Rhetoric and Composition is at the intersection of research, technical communication, creative writing, journalism, and literary analysis. It is a multidisciplinary study that is always concerned with speaker and audience, intent and impact, and context of messages. </p>
            Communications scholar, Thomas Farrell, calls rhetoric “the art of making things matter.” Rhetoric is studied with composition and communication because those are the ways rhetoric takes its form. For simplicity’s sake, composition and communication means writing and speaking. But I like to complicate things. So when I tend to ask how different languages, technologies, and orientations to the world change how my writing will land. </p>
            I use rhetoric and composition to make things matter. What matters to you?   </p>
